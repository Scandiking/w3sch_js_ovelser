### Øvelser fra W3Schools i JavaScript

Repository of the smaller tasks from W3Schools about JavaScript featuring loads of comments for my own learning's sake.

---

Comments mostly in Norwegian but English when it felt apt.

### Supplimentary activities

These files are just for my own sake and to "get dirty" doing the work that's needed for active Learning rather than receiving a passive lecture and gives bite-sized experience needed for bigger Projects such as my magnum opus (lol) _"Restaurantoppgaven"_ where classes interact With each other and aren't just single mains.

Using Git to push commits to Github is something I think is useful for pushing oneself to code a little each day to get that Sweet Third-Space Learning onboard [Kupiainen, R., 2013](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2304/pfie.2013.11.1.37).)
